      <h1>Christmas in Woodboro with Family</h1>
      <p>This past winter, I returned to Wisconsin to stay with my host family when I was an exchange student my sophomore year in high school. We went to Woodboro after Christmas, and this set of photos shows us playing at the lake, and you can see in these eight photos that we were building the snow fort, and how the sky changed.</p>

      <figcaption>
        The seventh photo was taken before we left the lake, I was standing at about the same place as the second photo. You can clearly see how much the sky has changed.

      <figcaption>
        The eighth photo was taken as we left the lake and I was on the steps of the lakeside cabin. The sky was golden at this point, the look of the sun's afterglow.
